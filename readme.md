# InvestorTracker

## Description

This project aims to simplify the process of monitoring investments in shares, funds and other financial assets. It receives files in Excel format generated by the B3 (Brazilian Stock Exchange) portal and imports and processes the data contained in these files. At the end of the process, the project consults updated information on the share price value through the yFinance library and generates a consolidated report on your investment portfolio, providing a comprehensive view of current positions and asset performance.
